<!-- <h2 class="fw-medium mt-4">Summary</h2>
<p>Permanent Pixels are 50 “pixel” X 50 “pixel” images that are generated and stored 100% on chain on the Polygon
    network, in a truly random manner (using Chainlink VRF). Each image contains 2500 “pixels,” all of which have an
    equally likely chance to be black or white. There can be up to 10,000,000 (10 Million) Permanent Pixels created.</p>

<h2 class="fw-medium mt-5">Rarity and Metadata</h2>
<p>Permanent Pixels have two different rarity measures that are important to pay attention to. Visual Resemblance, which
    refers to how much the Permanent Pixel looks like something, and Mathematical Rarity, which refers to how
    mathematically likely it was for a Permanent Pixel to be randomly generated. Mathematical Rarity is included in the
    metadata but Visual Resemblance is not, as Visual Resemblance is too subjective to quantify. In addition to
    Mathematical Rarity, the metadata will also include the name of the NFT (pulled from what number in the collection
    it is), the on-chain image data, and its skew, which describes if there are more black than white squares in the
    image, or an equal amount.</p>
<h2 class="fw-medium mt-5">Cost and supply</h2>
<p>There will be a max supply of 10 million Permanent Pixels. Each Permanent Pixel will cost .33 Matic to mint
    (excluding network fees). There is no limit to the number of Permanent Pixels that can be minted by one person,
    although a max of 1000 can be minted per request. The Permanent Pixels team does not take any royalties on secondary
    sales of Permanent Pixels (please be aware that NFT marketplaces can still take a percentage of sales revenue).</p>
